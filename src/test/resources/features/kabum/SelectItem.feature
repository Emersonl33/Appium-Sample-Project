  So that I can proceed to checkout on Kabum's store

  Scenario: Successfully add a product to the cart
    Given I am on the Kabum homepage
    And I search for "RTX 5070"
    When I select the product "Placa de VÃ­deo Gigabyte RTX 5070 AERO 12G NVIDIA GeForce, 12GB GDDR7, 192bits" from the results
